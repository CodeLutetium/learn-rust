# Shape-Calculator
1. Create a superclass Shape. A shape has 3 properties: 
    - Area
    - Perimeter
    - Color

2. Create the following subclasses and implement traits:
    - Rectangle
    - Circle
    - Triangle

3. Implement ```change_colour``` that allows you to change the colour of a shape

4. Make use of packages/ crates to structure code
